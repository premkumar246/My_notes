# Naive Bayes 
- The aim of Machine Leanring is to generate models which can perform tasks like Regression & Classification.
- To achieve this Machine Leanring takes support of different mathematics branches for formulating various mathematical approaches to solve the above mentioned problems like Regression & Classification.

Examples:
- **Linear Regression**
    - The approach of linear regression is to construct a line which represents the trend of the data points in the n dimensional hyperspace using an algebraic equation and substitute values of an instance in the variables to get the prediction.
    - The concepts which are used to formulate this algorithm are Covariance, Correlation and algebraic equations.
- **Logistic Regression**
    - The apprach of logistic regression is to construct a sigmoid curve which represents the probabilities of every instance of belonging to a class and dividing the data points based on the probability predicted by this sigmoid curve comparing to the threshold of probability we set prior.
    - This algorithm is based on the concepts like Odds, Odds Ratio, log odds and threshold probability.

- Similarly there are other machine learning algorithms which are based on many concepts of probability theory for solving the mentioned problems.
- One of such concepts is called Bayes Theorem.
